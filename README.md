👋 Hey, I'm Lewis Krygger, a software engineer with a passion for tech and hands-on experience in satellite systems and automated testing.

🛰️ I’ve always been inspired by space. Fortunately my tech journey has enabled me to work on cutting-edge satellite technologies. Helping Australia gain sovereign capabilities for disaster management and advanced manufacturing.

👾 Most of my work has involved the development of an automated testing and operations service, always striving to uphold the "test as you fly" philosophy. I've also delved into the intricacies of embedded flight hardware, handling both bare-metal and Linux systems.

🤖 Through my time I have noticed how much of a force multiplier great DevOps can be, so I’m passionate about empowering my team to achieve more, better, faster. 

🍻 I'm always open to connecting,  Let's chat and share our passion for tech and space!
